## Immunisation

Activities conducted in the Blood Pressure and Vascular Function Laboratory fall under the Macquarie University Immunisation Policy and Procedure. Immunisation, or proof of past immunisation is required as per the Policy. See the Procedure for actions to take before starting any work in the Blood Pressure and Arterial Function Laboratory.
[https://staff.mq.edu.au/work/strategy-planning-and-governance/university-policies-and-procedures/policies/immunisation](https://staff.mq.edu.au/work/strategy-planning-and-governance/university-policies-and-procedures/policies/immunisation)

## Notes on specific procedures

<img src='images/bpaf_laboratory.jpg' align='right' width='50%'>

### Before starting any experiment or measurements:

1.	**Locate the SDS folder** and other documents/posters in the room that may be required in case of emergency.
2.	**Ensure the area around where the participant will be positioned is clear.**
3.	Perform a **visual check of electrical equipment cords** for fraying/damage before use. Check the review date on the sticker is within past 12 months. If an issue is noted, tag the item for inspection and not for use, and report for maintenance review via the property service request system: https://ofm.mq.edu.au/service_request.html 

### After any experiment or measures

1.	**Wipe down any surface that has come into contact with the participant’s skin with 80% vol/vol ethanol.** This includes the inner surface of blood pressure cuffs.
2.	**Use disinfectant to soak any apparatus that has conducted the participants breath.** Consult disinfectant instructions for effective use. Consult the disinfectant SDS and use gloves if skin contact may cause irritation.
3.	**Tidy room.** The Blood Pressure and Vascular Function Laboratory is visited by members of the public and should always be clean and tidy. **This is also a safety issue** as a clear working area is easier to navigate in case of emergency.

### Ultrasonography
- Always write the date of opening on the ultrasound gel bottle.
- Check opening date of the ultrasound gel bottle and discard if it has been opened for 1 month or more.

### Maneuvers altering blood pressure
- Before any maneuver that potentially lowers blood pressure (for example: tilt-test; Valsalva maneuver; release of cuff on lower limb after a period of inflation likely to cause an ischaemic response), **verbally check with the participant that they are feeling ok** and not at all faint or light-headed.
- **Do not start a maneuver that may drop blood pressure if the participant is feeling faint, dizzy, or light-headed.** In the case of cuffs being inflated on limbs and the participant feeling unwell, release the cuff pressure slowly over 2 to 3 minutes to avoid any sudden, acute drop in blood pressure.
- Consult “Participant faints, feels light-headed or dizzy” under “Emergency procedures” below in the case of participants fainting, feeling dizzy or light-headed, and/or pale, cool, or clammy to touch.

### Microneurography
- Microneurography **needles must be cleaned, heat sterilized and packed** (at Macquarie University Hospital) according to manufacturer’s instructions (see appendix E).
- Check the needle tip is not damaged or bent. Discard if it is.
- Care should be taken at all times when handling microneurography needles as **needlestick injury is a hazard**. This is especially important once the needle has come into contact with the participant as the needle could then carry material to the investigator if stuck with the needle.

### Work involving children
If an investigator is to be involved in a study where the participants are, or may be, children the investigator will be required to undergo a Working With Children Check and send a copy of the issued certificate to the HR enquiries officer.

### Severe cardiovascular events (e.g., stroke, heart attack)

Follow the “Clinical Observations and Deteriorating Patient policy ([Appendix A](AppendixA_Clinical_Observations_and_Deteriorating_Patient_Policy.pdf)).
1.	Get help by
    - Notifying reception of the incident (x2900 or 9812 2900 or walk to front desk). Ask reception to alert health professional(s) in the clinic to assist.
    - Call out for help.
    - When help arrives, ask them to call MQ Health security (x9999 or 9812 3403) and relay that there is a Code Blue.
2.	Follow “Code Blue” instructions as per Appendix A.
3.	Report incident as soon as possible after the incident (See section “Reporting incidents” for details).

### Participant experiences chest pain

1.	Follow the Chest Pain Management Policy ([Appendix B](AppendixB_Chest_Pain_Management_Policy.pdf)).
2.	Get help by
    - Notifying reception of the incident (x2900 or 9812 2900 or walk to front desk).
    - Call out for help.
    - Activate Code Blue/Rapid response if clinical concerns or chest pain>10 minutes.
3.	Report incident as soon as possible after the incident (See section “Reporting incidents” for details).


### Participant faints, feels light-headed or dizzy, and/or pale, cool, clammy to touch

1.	Immediately support the participant to avoid them hitting their head as per MQ Health Safe Work Instruction Assisting a falling or fallen patient ([Appendix C](AppendixC_Assisting_a_falling_or_fallen_patient.pdf)). 
2.	If the participant is on the tilt-table, move the table to a horizontal position. If the participant is seated:
    - follow above MQ Health Safe Work Instruction Assisting a falling or fallen patient.
    - immediately and rapidly remove any recording equipment which may hinder moving the participant to a supine position.
3.	Raise the participant’s legs (either pillows under straightened legs or knees up with feet on the ground).
4.	Notify reception assistance is required (x2900 or 9812 2900 or walk to front desk).
5.	Note time of event and monitor blood pressure and heart rate.
6.	Keep participant in a supine position for a minimum of 10 minutes, or longer, until participant is feeling well and ready to slowly sit up again.
7.	Report incident as soon as possible after the incident (See section “Reporting incidents” for details).


### Violent participant
1.	Remove yourself from the danger (leave the room, find the company of other people in the clinic). If you cannot leave the laboratory, activate the distress button underneath the desk – this directly links to Hospital security.
2.	Contact MQ Health security (x9999 or 9812 3403) and relay the nature of the threat.
3.	Report the incident as soon as possible after the incident (See section “Reporting incidents” for details).

Suggestions on how to manage aggressive behaviours are provided in [Appendix F](AppendixF_Fact_Sheet_Managing_Aggressive_Behaviour.pdf) “Tips on how to manage aggressive behaviours”.

## Reporting incidents

- Report the incident to your supervisor, the practice manager and online at the link below. 
- Submit a report via the Macquarie University online reporting form: https://staff.mq.edu.au/support/other-resources/online-systems/roar as soon as possible and within 24 hours.
- If the event occurred in a study covered by a human ethics application at Macquarie University, submit a report via the Human Research Ethics Management system: https://www.mq.edu.au/research/ethics-integrity-and-policies/ethics/human-ethics/post-approval as soon as possible and within 48 hours.
- If the incident involves an MQ Health patient, the practice manager or their delegate will lodge a Riskman report for the MQ Health patient safety and quality team to review.

## Scheduled maintenance
- Electrical equipment safety testing and tagging should be conducted annually as part of the MQ Health facilities management preventative maintenance schedule.
- Calibration of blood pressure measurement devices should be conducted annually by biomedical engineering contractors as part of the MQ Health facilities management preventative maintenance schedule.
